This is a repo for my learning of performance engineering

I'm following the MIT Open Courseware course 6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems

The course can be found on the [MIT website](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/)
and the lectures on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63VIBQVWguXxZZi0566y7Wf)
